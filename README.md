# trams-drivers
This microservice for the TraMS platform stores driver information through REST and displays it to authorised individuals through a web client.

**How to use**

1. To use the microservice you need to specify the user specific configuration parameters in application.properties and application-production.properties. 
2. Create an executable jar using mvn clean install.
3. Run the jar (for example in production mode): java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar trams-drivers.jar

**How to use the integrated Admin Client and Swagger **

The microservice comes with an integrated admin client which allows you to create and view driver information. This admin interface is available at https://your-domain/trams-drivers/admin/ The initial username and password is admin/admin.

You can save and view data to trams-drivers through any language by calling the REST interface which is documented by Swagger and reachable through this URL:  https://your-domain/trams-drivers/swagger-ui.html

**Available Profiles**
* local - This profile uses an in-memory database but does not use Eureka for service discovery. This works well for local development.
* dev - This profile uses an in-memory database and Eureka for service discovery. This works well for development and testing.
* production - This profile uses Eureka for service discovery and can be configured to use a database.

**Acknowledgements**
The example from Roland Kr√ºger on implementing Vaadin with Spring Security (https://github.com/rolandkrueger/vaadin-by-example/tree/master/en/architecture/SpringBootSecurity) was very helpful for implementing the security part of the admin client and part of the code is based on this example.
